#UX Design vision.

# User & Business Goals #

User:
**To learn the learning style of another person without requiring their assistance, for a variety of benefits** To analyze one's own writing for the purpose of adjusting it for consumption by a particular learning style

Business Goals:
**To learn to code (Python, html, css)** To begin a portfolio of apps to learn from (fail fast with low risk, in Agile parlance)
**To provide an open source service to the community, in the spirit of fostering better communication**

PKIs:
**Increased understanding of Web App anatomy** Basics of Python, html & css absorbed and implemented in a working app
**Functions for users are tested and proven to work as stated in user goals**

Desired outcome:
**That the "business" benefits when the user achieves their goal**



# Details #


## Psychology ##

What is the user’s motivation to be here?
**Gain insight into others** Apply knowledge of learning styles to create greater rapport, clearer communication or increase uptake of information for another person

How does this make them feel?
**Capable, self-determining**

How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?
**Current state: Land on page, read enough to click to the tool page, locate sample text, copy/paste, hit enter** Desired: Rework the tool page to be the landing page. Move results to a second page. Land on page, locate sample text, copy/paste, hit enter.

What habits are created if they do this over and over?
**Bookmark the tool page - rework to be the landing page instead?**

What do they expect when they click this?
**To see the learning style breakdown from the sample text** To see the words called out and highlighted within their original input so that they can gain an understanding of how their communication is crafted

Are you assuming they know something that they haven’t learned yet?
**Somewhat. Copy & explanations could be re-worked to improve their education and call out the attractiveness of using Learning Styles in their lives**

Is this something they want to do again? Why? How often?
**Potentially** Salesperson. With every new client, or with every written communication they send out to be sure they are "speaking" in their clients style
**Writers. To analyze their voice and modulate it to be balanced (for mass appeal) or targeted to a style** Co-workers. As a way to understand and work with others more smoothly

Are you thinking of the user’s wants and needs, or your own?
**Both as the app started as a Tool I, as a user, wanted access to** Need more feedback of how others would want to use or find it helpful

How are you rewarding good behavior?
**Free access to this knowledge**


## Usability ##
Could you get the job done with less input from the user?
Are there any user mistakes you could prevent? (Hint: Yes, there are.)
Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?
Is it easy to find (good), hard to miss (better), or subconsciously expected (best)?
Are you working with the user’s assumptions, or against them?
Have you provided everything the user needs to know?
Could you solve this just as well by doing something more common?
Are you basing your decisions on your own logic or categories, or the user’s intuition? How do you know?
If the user doesn’t read the fine print, does it still work/make sense?
## Design ##
Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?
**unknown**

Does it communicate the purpose and function without words?
**unknown**

Does it represent the brand? Does it all feel like the same site?
**No. The input boxes do not fit the rest as of 4/2/2014**

Does the design lead the user’s eyes to the right places? How do you know?

Do the colors, shapes, and typography help people find what they want and improve usability of the details?

Do clickable things look different than non-clickable things?
**Yes. Menu items are distinct & have rollover color interaction. Links are blue and underlined, changing to purple and underlined once followed. Logo is clickable. Buttons are the other clickable items.**

## Copywriting ##
Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?
Does it motivate the user to complete their goal? Is that what we want?
Is the biggest text the most important text? Why not?
Does it inform the user or does it assume that they already know what its about?
Does it reduce anxiety?
Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?


## Analysis ##
Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?
Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?
Have you collected information that can give you those types of answers?
Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behavior?
Are you looking at absolute numbers, or relative improvements?
How will you measure this? Are you measuring the right things?
Are you looking for bad results too? Why not?
How can you use this analysis to make improvements?
