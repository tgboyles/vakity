This how-to describes how to commit code changes to the SCM.


# Details #

  * From your local workstation, open the Google App Engine Launcher

  * Select the 'vakity-test-analyzer' project from the project list and click the 'Run' button

  * Test the site using the [Testing](Testing.md) plan

  * Once all tests have passed, open your IDE

  * From the PyDev Package Explorer pane, select the project root (vality.trunk) and control-click

  * From the context menu, select 'Team > Commit'

  * In the resulting 'Commit' dialog, enter a relevant comment about the commit (e.g. Updating CSS and html for better formatting) and review the changes in the 'Changes' list. Under most circumstances, you should commit everything, but there may be cases where you want to exclude certain changes. These can be unchecked.

  * Once satisfied, click the 'OK' button
