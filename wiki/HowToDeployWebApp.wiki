= Introduction =

This HowTo describes how to deploy the webapp to GoogleCode. It assumes that you already have the project set up in the GoogleAppEngineLauncher and have the correct credentials for the App Engine console.


= Details =

   * From your local workstation, open the GoogleAppEngineLauncher

   * Select the 'vakity-test-analyzer' project from the project list and click the 'Run' button

   * Test the site using the [Testing] plan

   * If all tests pass, ensure that all changes have been committed to the SCM using the [HowToCommitChangesToSCM] HowTo

   * Once you've verified that the changes have been committed, return to the GoogleAppEngineLauncher and click the 'Deploy' button

   * You will be presented with a sign-in dialog. Log in with your Google credentials

   * The 'Log Console' dialog will appear. Monitor the log output as it uploads the web-app, paying special attention to any errors or warnings that might appear. Report these immediately to our DevOps people. If you don't see any errors, the deployment is successful.

   * From the GoogleAppEngineLauncher, click the 'Dashboard' button
