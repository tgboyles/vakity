== Structure ==

Dictionaries consist of a set of three tuples, one for each of the V-A-K learning styles:
  * visual_dictionary
  * auditory_dictionary
  * kinesthetic_dictionary

Elements in the tuple may be a single word, or a phrase.

== Next Steps ==

Dictionaries may be abstracted to properties files at some point in the future.
